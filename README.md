# Homunculus (Status in progress)  
                

A library for training and using feedforward artificial neural networks, written entirely in C Ansi. This library is intended to be simple to use, reliable, hackable and usefull to understand artificial neural networks, thanks to the structure more similar to a biological neural network than to a mathematical representation.

# Building

Homunculus is self-contained in two files: homunculus.c and homunculus.h. To use Homunculus, simply add those two files to your project. If you dont understend how use it, see main.c that is a simple implementation.

# Features

C Ansi with no dependencies.
Contained in a single source code and header file.
All functions have notes.
Easily extendible.
Implements backpropagation training.
Implements different tipes of error calc : SSE and CEE.
Implements "Momentum updating rule".
Includes some examples.

# Status, notes, future implementation:
Further simplification of the code.
Complete translation of comments and notes in italian to english.
Implementation of a better function for dynamic updating of momentum and learning rate
