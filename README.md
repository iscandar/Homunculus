# Homunculus (Status in progress)
A library for neural networks, written entirely in C Ansi. This library is intended to be simple to use and easy to understand thanks to the structure more similar to a biological neural network than to a mathematical representation.

Status and notes

Currently in its primordial state, it only features a small feedforward - back propagation structure. With the use of sigmoid as a transfer function.
